# Price template formatter
Модуль Drupal 8 - Редактирование вывода цены шаблоном

# INTRODUCTION
------------

This module adds a new field formatter to show at the same time:
- The original price of the variation.

The initial idea arose in a project in which it was necessary to show the percentage of discount both in the lists of products and in the pages of detail.
